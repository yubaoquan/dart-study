# readme

I use this to study developing cli program with dart.

A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.

## run

```bash
dart run bin/xxx.dart
```

## build

```bash
dart compile exe bin/xxx.dart
```

## add dependency

```bash
dart pub add xxx
```
